App-Physics-ParticleMotion version 1.00
=======================================

tk-motion (and its implementation App::Physics::ParticleMotion)
is a tool to create particle simulations from any number of
correlated second order differential equations. From a more mathematical
point of view, one could also say it helps visualize the numeric solution
of such differential equations.

The program uses a 4th-order Runge-Kutta integrator to find the numeric
solution of the specified differential equations. We will walk through
an example configuration file step by step to show how the process works.
The format of the configuration files is the ordinary ini file format
as understood by Config::Tiny. (Should be self explanatory.)


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

On platforms that don't support the "./" notation, that would be:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install

If you wish, you may use the old MakeMaker style instead:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
